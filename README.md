A language application that users can use to learn new English words, they can also ban words they already know

A language learning web application that helps users learn English through API calls and random selection of English words or phrases.

The web application can use an API such as the Oxford English Dictionary API or the Merriam-Webster Dictionary API to fetch random English words or phrases and display their definitions, examples, and usage. Users can click on a button to fetch a new word or phrase and add it to their learning list.

The web application can also include a ban list feature where users can add words or phrases that they already know or are not interested in learning. This will prevent the web application from displaying those words or phrases again.

To enhance the learning experience, the web application can include features such as audio pronunciations, example sentences, and quizzes to test the user's understanding of the word or phrase.

Overall, this project can help users improve their English vocabulary and language skills in an engaging and interactive way.
