# Web Development Project 4 - language-app

This web app: 
A language learning web application that helps users learn English through API calls and random selection of English words or phrases.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
[1] All API used required enterprise version which really took a lot of time figuring how to use them but never worked in the end, until I found a free one
[2] Developed challenges with git which made it hard to retrieve the correct version of the already done work. Ended up pulling old ones which made me almost start the project afresh
